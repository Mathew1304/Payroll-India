## ❓ Common Questions

### **Q: Do I need to mark each employee separately?**
A: No! Click "Mark as Paid" once at the top, and it marks all employees for that month.

### **Q: What if an employee didn't get paid?**
A: Check their IBAN in their profile. If wrong, fix it and process an individual transfer through your bank.

### **Q: Can I undo "Mark as Paid"?**
A: Yes, but you'll need to contact support. Better to double-check before marking!

### **Q: Do I need to download payslips?**
A: Yes! Click "Download Payslip" for each employee and send to them via email.

### **Q: What's the Establishment ID?**
A: Your company's MOL (Ministry of Labour) registration number. It looks like: EST-12345678

### **Q: What if validation shows errors?**
A: Go to Employees page, find the employees with errors, click Edit, and fill in missing:
- Qatar ID (QID) - 11 digits
- IBAN - Must start with QA and be 29 characters

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Problem: WPS file won't upload to bank**
**Solutions:**
- Check file isn't corrupted
- Verify Establishment ID is correct
