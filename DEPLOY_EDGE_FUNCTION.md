### Option 2: Using Supabase Dashboard

If CLI doesn't work, you can deploy via the dashboard:

1. Go to **https://supabase.com/dashboard**
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Edge Functions** in the left sidebar
4. Click **"Deploy new function"** or find `create-employee-user`
5. Copy the contents of `supabase/functions/create-employee-user/index.ts`
6. Paste into the editor
7. Click **"Deploy"**

---

## 🧪 Test the Function

### Step 1: Test from Application

1. Go to your app (http://localhost:5173)
2. Navigate to **Employees** → **Add Employee**
3. Fill in the form:
   - First Name: "Test"
   - Last Name: "User"
   - Company Email: "testuser@example.com"
   - Mobile Number: "1234567890"
   - Date of Joining: (today's date)
4. **Check** the "Create Login" checkbox
5. Click **"Save"**

### Step 2: Verify Success

You should see:
- ✅ Success modal with credentials displayed
- ✅ No CORS errors in console
- ✅ Employee created in database
- ✅ User account created

### Step 3: Verify Data Integrity

Check in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Verify user_id is linked to employee
SELECT 
  e.id,
  e.first_name,
  e.last_name,
  e.company_email,
  e.user_id,
  up.user_id as profile_user_id,
  up.role,
  up.employee_id
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN user_profiles up ON e.user_id = up.user_id
WHERE e.company_email = 'testuser@example.com';
```

**Expected Result:**
- `e.user_id` should be populated (not null)
- `up.user_id` should match `e.user_id`
- `up.employee_id` should match `e.id`
- `up.role` should be 'employee'

## 🔍 What the Function Does Now

1. **Creates Auth User** with email/password
2. **Creates User Profile** in `user_profiles` table with:
   - `user_id` (links to auth.users)
   - `employee_id` (links to employees)
   - `role` = 'employee'
   - `is_active` = true
3. **Updates Employee Record** with `user_id` to complete the link
4. **Returns** user data and password to frontend

### Error Handling:
- If profile creation fails → Deletes auth user (rollback)
- If employee update fails → Deletes auth user (rollback)
- All errors are logged and returned to frontend

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### "supabase: command not found"
Install Supabase CLI:
```powershell
npm install -g supabase
```

### "Project not linked"
Run:
```powershell
supabase link --project-ref xbqzohdjjppfgzxbjlsa
```

### "Permission denied"
Make sure you're logged in:
```powershell
supabase login
```

### Still getting CORS errors after deployment
1. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment to propagate
2. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check function logs in Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions → Logs
